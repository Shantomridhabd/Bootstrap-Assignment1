Design Choices:


Focus on Movies: The overall theme seems to be movie-centric. This is evident from the title "CineMagic" (Lights, Camera, Click!), the carousel showcasing movie trailers, and sections dedicated to trending and top-rated movies.

Modern and User-friendly Interface: The use of clear headings, a grid layout for displaying movies, and a search bar suggests an emphasis on a user-friendly experience.

Dark Background with Light Text: The combination of a dark background with light text creates a clean and visually appealing aesthetic.

Clean and Minimalist Aesthetic: The use of a light background with subtle shadows and a minimalist color palette creates a clean and modern look.

Consistent Typography: The consistent use of the "Poppins" font for body text and "Faculty Glyphic" for headings provides a cohesive and professional look.

Responsive Design: While not explicitly shown in the CSS, the use of Bootstrap's grid system and responsive utilities ensures that the layout adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes.

Interactive Elements: The hover effects on movie cards and social media icons add a touch of interactivity and visual interest.

Clear and Readable Typography: The use of appropriate font sizes, line heights, and letter spacing ensures that the text is easy to read.




Bootstrap Features and Integration:


Grid System: The HTML structure, combined with Bootstrap's grid classes, is likely used to create the responsive layout, especially for the movie card sections.

Cards: Bootstrap's card component is used to display movie information, including title, image, description, and a "Play Now" button. The CSS styles enhance the visual appeal of these cards.

Buttons: Bootstrap's button component is used for the "Play Now" button and other action buttons.

Navbar: While not explicitly shown in the CSS, the HTML structure suggests the use of Bootstrap's navbar component for the navigation bar at the top of the page.
